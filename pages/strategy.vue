Strategy

    My goal is to invest in Infrastructure projects, I mean tools that are used by everyone in the ecosystem. I’m satisfied with my investments in FFF and Subber, but now I want more exposition to Magic Eden tickets, Helions, and eventually Matrica.

    I try to farm mint whitelists and pre-sales with my recent Subber key acquisitions (I got 10 boosts). I will do it for a few months and decide if it’s worth going on.

    From an art collector point of view, I’m looking too for an ivory Portals to set up a gallery.

    Once I succeed with my goals, I will look into IP projects like The Bastards or Claynozaurz.

    My selling points are:
        x2 by default
        Exit earlier if I’m in need of liquidity and already profitable on the collection

    I will pump my Fox to level 60 and sell it for Transdimensional Foxes and $SOLs to keep some exposition to FFF while getting liquidity to keep in my wallet or to achieve my Portals and infrastructure investments goals.

    I will add $SOLs from my FIAT bank account on a regular basis
