<h1>NFT Trading guide basics</h1>

<h2>Probabilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    NFT trading is a bit like poker. The goal is not to win every time, but to make moves which are more likely to win.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you make x10 on a degen mint you shouldn’t be proud of your move, because the odds were against you, only luck saved you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most investments will fail. But a few good investments will be big wins and compensate all the others and makes you profitable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mints are gambling and the probabilities are not in your favor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Degen mints are pure gambling and the probabilities are really not in your favor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hyped mints are gambling and the probabilities are in your favor.<br>
    NB: Some collection DAOs get their value from getting you whitelist spots for the hyped mints.
  </li>
  <li>
    Like in any investment, diversify.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mints are like seed investment, you invest before having seen anything. It’s better to buy on secondary after observing the team for a few months.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you are confident about a team and see the price dumps for a non-valid reason, it’s a good time to buy. The chances of floor price increase are higher.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can do everything right and still have bad luck. Don’t forget that your NFTs are money too, so don’t put you at risk financially when investing in NFTs.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Web2 VC inspiration</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    VCs start by investing the same amount of money in every project they get into.
  </li>
  <li>
    The bet a lot on teams.
  </li>
  <li>
    They observe the projects for months or years before getting in.
  </li>
  <li>
    They invest in sectors (games, B2B, B2C, social networks, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    They invest in specific growth stages (seed, series, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    They look for a x10, some x2 and know they will lose everything with the rest.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Small collections</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Small collections are harder to trade but leads to more direct trading between collectors.
  </li>
  <li>
    It’s easier to network within small collections. All members are accessible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because there are less people, everyone is more visible. To make sure your NFTs keep their price, be active and try to bring value with hindsight, good vibes, advice, introductions, whitelists, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bidding</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Look for rare pieces where the owner decreases frequently the price. Bid with a 10-20% discount or slightly above the floor price. They will probably accept.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place a reasonable collection bid on projects you like. Many people need liquidity fast, they will enjoy to accept your bid
  </li>
  <li>
    Be aware that your liquidity is not available quickly when you bid (you have to remove it from the bid to access it again).
  </li>
  <ul>
    On some marketplaces, bidding prevents you from royalties.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>1/1s</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    1/1 prices can be a lot more above a collection floor.
  </li>
  <li>
    1/1, tied to a collection or not, are mainly traded inside communities through direct discussions. Only strong believers are ready to put big amount of money on the table.
  </li>
  <li>
    These discussions can be stressful and there is no right price. It’s just a discussion between two passionate people. If you want to be sure of what you are doing, check recent similar trades on ME or ask on the related Discord. It might help.
  </li>
  <li>
    During bearish time for a collection, the 1/1 price drops significantly.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you sell with profit, you are never wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    For collection 1/1s, make sure you sell them at a multiple of the floor price.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always use trusted tools like Foxyswap to secure these deals.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Reveal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The collection price dumps shortly after a reveal. It’s because people expect to have a rare. Holding before revealing is a bit gambling. Because all the people unsatisfied with their reveal dump it as fast as possible. Even when they like the collection. Because they will be able to buy something they prefer right after.
  </li>
  <li>
    The safest option is to sell when the collection is trendy before the reveal. It’s probable, that you will be able to get in right after.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Casino projects</h2>

<p>
Casinos are bad for many reasons. Even if they can unsure a quick flip, you should avoid it because :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    They drain wallets of Solana users and can destroy lives.
  </li>
  <li>
    They don’t give a good image of the NFT market when newcomers come.
  </li>
  <li>
    They don’t bring any value.
  </li>
  <li>
    They rug often.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the long term they mine the ecosystem.
  </li>
</ul>
