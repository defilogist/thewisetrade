  <h1>Strategy</h1>

  <p>
    My goal is to invest in Infrastructure projects, I mean tools that are used
    by everyone in the ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m satisfied with my investments in FFF and Subber, but now I want more
    exposition to Magic Eden tickets, Helions, and eventually Matrica.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I succeed with my infrastructure investments, I will look into IP
    projects like The Bastards or Claynozaurz.
  </p>
  <p>
    My selling points are: x2 by default Exit earlier if I’m in need of
    liquidity and already profitable on the collection I will pump my Fox to
    level 65 and sell it for Transdimensional Foxes and $SOLs to keep some
    exposition to FFF while getting liquidity to keep in my wallet
    infrastructure investments goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have 30 sols in liquidity I will use it to farm some Tensor and Citrus
    points via AMM. I will only do quick buy and sell with it. With the gains I
    will buy Helions and ME tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will sell my art projects when the selling point will be satisfying again.
