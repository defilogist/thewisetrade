      <h1>Why</h1>

      <p>
        The Solana NFT ecosystem is wonderful by its creativity and the
        willingness of the collection creators. But the degen trend, despite its
        funniness, doesn’t provide a good image to newcomers. Investors with big
        liquidites or projects with experienced teams may be scared by the
        casino atmosphere reigning in the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to attract better projects and bigger investors, the Solana NFT
        ecosystem needs to have more traders that acts wisely. If we show that
        we use good strategies and propose a sane framework to get in, it will
        be easier for other users to bet on NFTs.

      <p>
        That’s why I wrote content to help everyone in the ecosystem to become
        better at trading NFTs. The Wise NFT Trader is a compilation of guides
        and tips that will help you to set up efficient investment strategies
        and avoid you the most common mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By understanding how works the available tools and applying best
        practices, you will increase your chance of success and make the
        NFT ecosystem a better place.
