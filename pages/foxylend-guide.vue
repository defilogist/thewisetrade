<h1>The Foxylend Guide</h1>

<h2>Borrowing</h2>

Borrowing may makes you feel like you are in a needy situation and that it could turn against you. With Foxylend that’s not the case. You pay upfront a fox for a mission and that’s it: there is no hidden cost. The only question you have to answer before borrowing a fox is: is it worth to do it?

<h3>Evaluate fame rewards</h3>

The answer is not that simple, because it’s mainly tied to how much you value fame points. Basically a mission rewards you with chest and fame points. To enter into a mission, sometimes you miss elements like a second fox or simply a fox. So the parameters you have to take into account before renting a fox is to consider from where you start and what you will obtain with this mission. In other words you have to evaluate how much extra fames and chests you will get.

<h3>Look for x2 missions</h3>

The best time to borrow is for a x2 mission, because the borrowing will give you more chests and more fame to your fox. x1 missions can be interesting too, but the benefit will in chests only.

<h3>Double check your borrowing</h3>

You have to really think before doing a borrow because it cannot be canceled. So first make sure you are borrowing the right fox for your mission. Things can go wrong especially when there are missions where two different traits are needed. Some foxes will appear as eligible while you already have their traits.

<h3>Do the maths</h3>

Now everything is clear, to help you with this decision, I built a table showing what you will obtain depending from where you start. To build this table, I made the following assumptions (please adapt the number depending on their market value):

<ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-2 mb-2">
  <li>1 chest costs 0.15 sols (average price on FFF token market)</li>
  <li>1000 fame points costs 0.15 sols (average price on FFF token market)</li>
  <li>1000 $FOXY costs 0.2 sols</li>
  <li>A x2 mission + den brings 22 000 fame instead of 8000, so it brings 14 000 fame</li>
  <li>A x2 mission brings 20 000 fame instead of 8000, so it brings 12 000 fame</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>NB: Here I consider we sell the chests but you could for sure keep them to
open and hope for higher rewards but it comes with an increased risk. The fame
points cannot be sold but it represents the extra cost if you wanted to buy
them.</em>
</p>

<h3>Mission rewards borrowing and borrowing investment</h3>

<p>
Be cautious with rewards:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-2 mb-2">
  <li>Adapt fames rewards to your actual mission</li>
  <li>Check the chest value on the token market</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <em>Borrowing that bring extra rewards</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>!!! The gain evaluation is based on fame, so it should be taken cautiously !!!</em>

<h2>Lending</h2>


<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
The lending benefits are much simpler. You are missing elements to send your
fox directly to a mission or you prefer a good amount of $FOXYs instead of
chests. So, the simplest thing to do is to lend it to someone for a bunch of
$FOXYs. You will gain experience from the mission but your fox will be sent
back only when its mission finishes.
</p>


<h3>Chose the right price</h3>

<p>
That’s a good idea but how to set the right price? There is no magic recipe.
The price range is roughly 1500-4000 $FOXY for a Fox and 400-1700 for a TFF.
If you set a low price, it’s more likely that your fox will be chosed fast.
But you can try to be at the top of the range, wait longer and cross fingers
for your fox to be borrowed.
</p>

<p>
Set low price for faster renting and higher price for more but riskier rewards.
</p>


<p>
NB: We saw in the borrow guide that the best outcome for a borrower is to
complete a x2 mission. If there are no x2 missions, you should lower your
lending expectations.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
Don’t try to rent a fox for a free price just to get the extra fame. Some users
will punish you by renting it and removing it from the market.
</p>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>
That’s it! As you understand, Foxylend can really improve your passive income.
It should be considered if you want to level up your Fox faster and wants to
be able to buy its upgrades. Done properly it will allow you to get extra fames
or extra chests at a good price.
