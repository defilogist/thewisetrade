<h1>About</h1>

<p>
All contents are written by me, Defilogist, a blockchain and NFT enthusiast who
started trading NFTs after making significant gains with crypto. I ran from 4k$
and made around 50k$, I cashed out half and invested the rest in NFTs and small
caps cryptos.
</p>

<p>
From there I did all the mistakes possible and to be honest, I lost a lot
of money… After these hard-learned lessons, I was able to get back to a stable
situation and a growing portfolio. It took me a year to learn from my errors.
</p>

<p>
With my content, I want to save you a precious time and prevent you from
classic traps.
</p>

<p>
That’s why in this website, you will find tons of tips to start with NFT
trading and especially in the Solana ecosystem. We need more wise traders and I
will help you to become one!
</p>

<p>
Note: I decided to be transparent. So, I share with you my portfolio. You
can see how things evolve for me and know more about my trades.
