    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      All contents are written by me, Defilogist, a blockchain and NFT
      enthusiast who started trading NFTs after making significant gains with
      crypto. I ran from 4k$ and made around 50k$, I cashed out half and
      invested the rest in NFTs and small caps cryptos.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there I did all the mistakes possible and to be honest, I lost a lot
      of money… After these hard-learned lessons, I was able to get back to a
      stable situation and a growing portfolio. It took me a year to learn from
      my errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      With my content, I want to save you a precious time and prevent you from
      classic traps.

      trading and especially in the Solana ecosystem. We need more wise traders
