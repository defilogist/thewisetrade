      The Solana NFT ecosystem is wonderful by its creativity and the willingness of
      the collection creators. But the degen trend, despite its funniness, doesn’t
      provide a good image to newcomers. Investors with big liquidites or projects
      with experienced teams may be scared by the casino atmosphere reigning in the
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to attract better projects and bigger investors, the Solana NFT
      ecosystem needs to have more traders that acts wisely. If we show that we use
      good strategies and propose a sane framework to get in, it will be easier for
      other users to bet on NFTs.

      better at trading NFTs. The Wise NFT Trader is a compilation of guides and tips
      that will help you to set up efficient investment strategies and avoid you the
      most common mistakes.

      you will increase your chance of success and make the NFT ecosystem a better
