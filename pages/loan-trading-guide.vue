<h1>The Loan Trading Guide</h1>

<p>
Loaning can sound very fuzzy at first sight. Nevertheless, it’s a very handy tool that can improve your trading, especially when you want to be $SOL liquid while keeping your favourite NFTs.
</p>

<p>
That said, it is very risky tool. By giving you more flexibility, it will add volatility to your trades. If it’s not used properly, that can ruin all your holdings. So you should use it with extreme caution and think a lot before taking a loan. I recommend loans only for experimented traders.
</p>

<p>
Now you are aware of the situation, In this guide I’m going to tell you how borrowing can be used efficiently. I will cover too lending to see how to manage it properly.
</p>


<h2>Main principle</h2>

<p>
A lender proposes an amount of $SOLs to lend to a borrower but asks a NFT as a collateral in case the borrower can’t pay. It means that if one borrows the $SOLs (which are always lower than the NFT Floor price) and don’t pay back, the lender gets the NFT instead of the $SOL lent. Most of the time, payment default will be like instant selling your NFT at a discounted price.
</p>

<p>
All loans have a limited duration and come with some interests. These parameters are set by the lender, The lender earns money through the interest. Duration varies between 3 and 21 days and interest are between 2 and 3% for 7 days.
</p>

<p>
The interesting point is that if you default, you lose only your NFT, you don’t owe anything to anyone.
</p>


<h2>Platforms</h2>

<h3>What platform to use?</h3>

<p>
There are 3 main platforms to deal with borrowing: [Shark](https://sharky.fi/), [Citrus](https://citrus.famousfoxes.com/) and [Frakt](https://frakt.xyz/). The first one is the most used, Citrus is the new challenger, and Frakt is the older. [Rainfi](https://rain.fi/) is another alternative but with less volume.
</p>

<p>
Because, all of them are quite simple to use and provide extensive guides and tutorials, I won’t cover their usage. I will focus on the lending theory solely.
</p>

<p>
If you like statistics, the [Suipa](https://app.suipa.xyz/lending/collection) application provides a lot of insights on loans (volumes, defaults, average interest, etc.)
</p>

<h3>What are the deal parameters?</h3>

A lender sets:

<ul>
<li>How much sols he can furnish</li>
<li>The NFT collection to use as collateral</li>
<li>The duration (3, 5, 7, 14 or 21 days)</li>
<li>The intest rate (between 2 and 10% depending on the duration).</li>
</ul>

<h3>How platforms work?</h3>

<p>
They work in a similar way: lenders list deals and borrowers can pick the deals they are interested in. Borrowers can propose deals too and be picked, it’s like a classic trading order book (the way deals work is described in the next paragraphs).
</p>

<p>
NB: Some offers can be sent privately. They are dealt on a separate chat platform and the lender set it for a singe wallet via one of the lending platform.
</p>

<h2>Borrowing</h2>

<h3>When to borrow?</h3>

<p>
Basically you borrow $SOL when you need liquidites for a trade. It’s often for a mint of which the outcome will be known quickly or for investing in collections that will likely pump soon (bullish announcement, incoming airdrop for collection holders or similar). In both cases you will have to cash out quickly to pay back your loans and avoid activating the collateral NFT selling. Loans are mainly for short term investments.
</p>

<p>
My recommandation is to borrow 30% maximum of your current holding. That way, if things go wrong, you will still be able to pay back the borrowing. The other option to limit risks is to be ready to lose the NFTs put as collateral.
</p>

<p>
Note that loaning can be good to enforce a trading strategy. They force you to cash out your trades at a given time. It avoids holding the NFT with false hope that its floor gets higher.
</p>


<h3>What is a good deal?</h3>

<p>
Interests amount is most of the time not significant compared to the expected gains of your upcoming trade. They should be considered but if the amount is a problem, it means that the deal is not that good or that there is an issue with your strategy.
</p>

<h3>Be Liquid</h3>

<p>
Another option to mitigate risks is to spend only the money you borrowed. So, you make sure you can pay it back in case of big loss. You still have your liquidity available in case of sudden new opportunities.
</p>

<p>
You are always liquid, meaning you have $SOLs avalaible in your wallet. You mainly invest money from others for your short term trades.
</p>

<h3>Set a stop loss</h3>

<p>
Another usage for borrowing is to set a stop loss on a NFT you are not sure of. You bought it at floor price and bet on the price volatility. To manage your risks, you want a bottom exit price. There is no tool for that (except AMMs but they are complicated to use, I will cover them in another guide), so you can put the NFT as collateral of a borrowing. It will make you more liquid while setting your stop loss. But you will have to pay interests for this service if the stop loss is not activated.
</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
Be aware of the gambler effect where you put all your NFTs as collateral and lose them one by one after many short terms failed opportunities. It could ruin your bag very fast and hurt your mental health.
</p>

<h3>Sum up</h3>

<p>
**Upside**: getting more liquidity, always be liquid, better investment strategy with stop-loss, enforce exits.
</p>

<p>
**Downside**: risk to lose NFT if your investments goes wrong or if you forget to pay back. Possible addiction that could ruin youn portfolio
</p>

<h3>Exemples from the field</h3>

<p>
1) Buddles Mint
</p>

<p>
- For the Buddles mint I had access to WL phase 1 at 2.5 $SOL and WL phase 2 at 2.75 $SOL.
- I had 2.6 $SOL in my wallet. I made a 3 $SOL loan on 7 days and put a Helion as collateral.
- I minted 1 Buddle at Phase 1 and 1 at Phase 2. I was expecting a lot from the mint.
- Finally it didn’t go as expected but I was able to sell them at 3.10 and 3.25.
- After paying pack my interest, it was still a 1 $SOL win. Without the loan it would be only a 0.6 $SOL gain. That’s a 40% difference.
</p>


<p>
2) The Bastards secondary
</p>

<p>
- Another exemple with Bastards. This time it went wrong.
- I had 9 $SOL in my wallet. FP was at 11 $SOL. I decided to take a 3 $SOL loan by putting an Helion as collateral and was able to buy one. I bought a bastard and had 12 $SOL in my wallet
- Things went wrong, the FP reached 9 $SOL.
- I decided to exit and got 10 $SOL on my wallet. Because I didn’t borrow to much, I was able to pay back my loan and got my NFT back and ended at 7 $SOL. I lost 23% of my initial investment.
</p>

<h3>Lending</h3>

<h3>When to lend?</h3>

<p>
The main benefit of lending is obvious: it allows to get interests from the borrower. On average it leads to 200-300% APR, which is huge compared to Solana validators (5-10%).
</p>

<p>
To set a lend you have to decide several parameters: the platform you use, the amount of $SOL loanedt the duration, the interest rate, the amount lent and the NFT used as collateral.
</p>

<p>
Be aware that the platform will get some fees. Some platform has better rate than others but overall they are in an decent range.
</p>

<h3>What deals can you propose?</h3>

<p>
You can look at other offers to be sure of what parameters you should chose. Once you set your deal, you just have to do the maths (platform helps you with that) and see if it’s worth the risk for you.
</p>

<p>
The deal has to be a bit far from floor to avoid payment defaults in case the collection dumps a bit. But it must not be too far, because it would make the loan not interesting for the borrower. On average proposals are between 15 and 20% below the floor. Check the offers made by other users, if they are better they will be selected before yours. Keep in mind that your deal must be accepted, it needs to be attractive.
</p>

<p>
Platform represents the above concept as LTV. It’s the pourcentage of the floor price you lend.
</p>

<p>
The other thing you can set is the interest rate which is usually around 2.5% for 7 days. Platform will present you with the form of APR but they will do maths with other parameters to show how much interests you gain in the end. You can set longer loans too, like 14 days or 21 days, the interest rate evolve accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line is your loan parameter depends on your patience, you are on a market with competitors. The more attractive the offer the faster it goes but the less the rewards you get.
</p>

<p>
NB: When popular mint occur, a lot of people are looking for liquidity. During this period you can make less attractive offers like 10% below floor with stronger interest rate.
</p>

<h3>How to deal with payment default ?</h3>

<p>
The payment default allows you to get a NFT at discount price. It can occur for two reasons:
</p>

<p>
- The borrower made bad trades and cannot pay back the loan. That’s a good situation, you get a NFT below its floor price.
- The collection you lended on dumped, the lender chosed to not repay his loan and you get the NFT at a higher price than the current floor price.
</p>

<p>
To avoid the second case, there is no magic recipe. The only thing you can do is to give loans only on collections you are ready to hold in case they dump. You can focus too on solid and stable collections to put the probabilities on your side.
</p>

<h3>Sum up</h3>

<p>
**Upside**: getting great APR for $SOL, acquiring NFTs at cheap price
</p>

<p>
**Downside**: Can end with an expensive NFT
</p>

<h2>Mortgage</h2>

<h3>What makes mortgages different than loans?</h3>

<p>
Mortgages are leverage tools for borrowers. From the lender point of view, it doesn’t change anything.
</p>

<p>
As a borrower, mortgages allow you to buy a NFT without having the liquidity yet. It’s a bet on the fact that a collection will pump soon. You buy a NFT with the difference between the floor price and royalties and the best loan offer. It allows you to get the NFT right now while you are still missing the liquidity to buy it. But, the NFT is frozen and can’t be traded until you pay the loan back.
</p>

<p>
The loan can be paid via an instant sell of the NFT. So, if things goes well you can trade out of your range NFT without having the liquidity for this. If you default, the initial money is lost and the NFT is given.
</p>

<p>
That’s still a risky tool. Its main utility is to allows you to buy several NFTs with less money, and it allows to add a multiplicator to your trades by buying more NFTs at the same time. In your previson, if you go for multiple NFTs, include the fact that royalty costs are multiplied too.
</p>

<h3>Exemple</h3>

<p>
Let’s take an example to make things clearer:
</p>

<p>
- At the time of the writing I can buy an Okay Bear mortgage at 18.5 $SOL with a Floor price at 75.
NB: If I had 80 $SOL in my wallet I could buy 4 Bears.
- If I take a mortgage, the Okay bear is now in my wallet and give me holder access to the Okay bear community. But, I get a loan of 61 $SOL and the NFT can’t be traded until I pay the loan.
- If the price goes up to 95, I can decide to fund the money borrowed, unlock the NFT and sell it on a market for a 20 $SOL gain (minus royalties and loan interests).
- If the price goes down at 65, I lose the 10 $SOL (plus royalties and loan interests)
- If I can’t find the missing liquidity I lose 18.5 $SOL.
- If the floor dumps harder like at 55, I can default my payment and lose 18.5 $SOL instead of 20.
</p>

<h3>To sum up</h3>

<p>
**Upside**: buying big NFT without being liquid enough, trading more NFTs at the same time
</p>

<p>
**Downside**: can lose the initial investment, loss is harder, add a layers of complexity on top of the loan
</p>

<h2>To conclude</h2>

<p>
Loans are tools to fix the fact that NFTs are not liquid. They allow you to have access to your $SOL while keeping holding them. Still they create more volatility in your investment and add more risks to them. In this guide, I did my best to give you a full understanding on how they work and how can they be helpful if used wisely. I hope it will help and keep in mind that you should always bet money you can afford to lose.
